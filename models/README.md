# Models

Models are defined in the subdirectories of this folder.

A model definition consists of a `README.md` that provides a human-friendly
description of the model.

Optionally, if the device does not send senML directly,
[transformers can be defined](../README.md#model-transformer-definitions) that
convert the payload sent by the model to senML.
