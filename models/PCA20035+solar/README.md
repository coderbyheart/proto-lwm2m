# Thingy:91 with Solar Shield

The Nordic Thingy:91 Solar Shield is a plug-and-play prototyping platform.
Powerfoyle solar cell is mounted onto the Thingy to quickly get started
exploring the endless possibilities with solar powered IoT applications and to
develop products with eternal life or even battery-free products.​

The Thingy:91 runs the
[`asset_tracker_v2` application](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/applications/asset_tracker_v2/README.html)
and sends messages to nRF Cloud using MQTT.
