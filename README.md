Documents the communication protocol between devices, the
`hello.nrfcloud.com/map` backend and web application.

The [`lwm2m`](./lwm2m/) folder contains the LwM2M objects that devices publish.

LwM2M object definitions are shared between models and can be re-used. Some
objects provide special behavior (for example object
[`14201` (Geolocation)](./lwm2m/14201.xml) will place the device's location on
the map).

Devices publish LwM2M objects using
[SenML](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8428) directly, which needs to
map to the defined LwM2M objects ([example](./senml/SenMLSchema.spec.ts)).

The SenML payload will be [expanded](./senml/senMLtoLwM2M.spec.ts) to fully
qualified LwM2M object representations which can then be processed further, e.g.
stored in a database.

This allows the `hello.nrfcloud.com/map` web application to visualize this data
in a meaningful way to users without the need for custom implementation.

## LwM2M rules

- `LWM2MVersion` must be `1.1`
- LwM2M objects are defined in the ID range from `14200` to `15000`
  (non-inclusively).
- The URN must have the prefix `urn:oma:lwm2m:x:`.
- The `ObjectVersion` must be appended if it is not `1.0`, which is the default.
- All objects must define one `Time` property.
- Objects must be `Multiple` instance.
- Objects must be `Optional`.
- Resources must be `Single` instance. `Multiple` could be useful in some cases,
  e.g. IP addresses, but until it is really needed, we do not support it.
- Resources should only be marked as mandatory in case they must be published
  together (e.g. latitude and longitude). This allows devices to only update the
  values that have changed.
- `RangeEnumeration` is only supported for `Float` and `Integer` and must be
  specified as `<min>..<max>`, where `min` must be smaller than `max` and both
  must be a number.
- `Objlnk` resource type is not supported

The conformity to the rules is checked using the script
[`./lwm2m/check-lwm2m-rules.ts`](./lwm2m/check-lwm2m-rules.ts).

## SenML rules

- The implementation follows the recommendation outline in section 7.4.5. of the
  [LwM2M v1.1.1 Technical Specification](https://openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.pdf):
  `bn` and `n` fields are combined to form the unique identifier for a resource
  in the form of `/<object ID>/<object instance ID>/<resource ID>/0`. The
  resource instance ID `0` is always appended, because multiple resource
  instances are not supported right now.
- Use the custom property `blv` to specify the object version, `1.0` is the
  default and should not be specified.
- Timestamps are to be expressed in the **base time** property `bt` and are
  mapped to the LwM2M object's timestamp property and must not be send as a
  property.

### Model definition rules

- **device models** are identified using a model name, for example
  `kartverket-vasstandsdata`
- a [`README.md`](./models/kartverket-vasstandsdata/README.md) must be provided
  that describes the model

The conformity to the rules is checked using the script
[`./models/check-model-rules.ts`](./models/check-model-rules.ts).
